This is my personal repo for my emacs config.

* Installation
How to install it:

- clone the repository
#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://codeberg.org/jcastp/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src
- launch =emacs=
- Open the file ~~/.emacs.d/emacs-config.org~
- Launch =org-babel-tangle= (tied to =C-c C-v C-t= in a vanilla =emacs=)
- exit =emacs= and launch it again

It will download all the required packages to work.

* Update
from the =~/.emacs.d= directory:
#+begin_src bash
  git pull
#+end_src
This will download all the changes from the remote repository.
