This is my personal repo for my emacs config.

* Installation
How to install it:

#+begin_src bash
  git clone ~/Nextcloud/config/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

and then launch emacs.

It will download all the required packages to work.

=~/Nextcloud/config/emacs.d= is an empty repository.

* Update
from the =~/.emacs.d= directory:
#+begin_src bash
  git pull
#+end_src
