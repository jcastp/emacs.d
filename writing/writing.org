This is my personal config for writing.

* Sentences end with just one space
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq sentence-end-double-space nil)
#+end_src

* Writeroom
Distraction free writing mode.
https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package writeroom-mode
    :ensure t
    :config
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c 5") 'writeroom-mode)

* Word count
Word counting with objective.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package wc-mode
    :ensure t
    :config
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c 9") 'wc-mode)

* Count words in orgmode, excluding comments, drawers, properties, etc
=count-words= function is good, but in orgmode still counts all the words, including comments, properties,drawers, etc.

These functions avoid that.
The main function is =org-context-count-words=, that has an extensive documentation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-context-extended
    :ensure t
    :vc (:url "https://codeberg.org/jcastp/org-context-extended"

#+end_src

* Add a property for orgmode headings with an advanced word count function
Modified the Emacs Writing Studio ([[https://github.com/pprevos/emacs-writing-studio][EWS]]) function to use my orgmode word count function.
It adds a property, called WORDCOUNT, to the headings so we can leverage in reports or other actions.
It also adds a custom id under every org heading, so we can link back to it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun writing/ews-org-count-words ()
      "Add word count to each heading property drawer in an Org mode buffer."
      (interactive)
      (org-map-entries
       (lambda ()
         (let* ((start (point))
                (end (save-excursion (org-end-of-subtree)))
                (word-count (org-context-count-words start end t t t t t t org-context-ignore-tags)))
           (org-set-property "WORDCOUNT" (number-to-string word-count)))
         ;; create the id to link the org heading
         (org-id-get-create))))
#+end_src

* TODO Dynamic block function to draw the wordcount of the sections
This function relies on a property in the org-heading called WORDCOUNT, that is generated by the function =writing/ews-org-count-words=. It will draw a sorted table with the word count of each section.

To create the dynamic block in the file, add this in the org file
#+begin_src
#+BEGIN: org-generate-wordcount-table
| Heading       | Wordcount |
|---------------+-----------|
| * [[Capítulo 01]] |         4 |

* TODO My editing function
I want to open my own view to edit my writing.
- I want to have a left window with the index of the file, usually an org mode file, so =imenu-list= is a good candidate.
- I want the central window to have the text, so it will host the main file I want to edit, for readability.
- I want the right window to host the file with notes. In my case, I use org-remark, so I have to find the associated filename.

This should be used
At the top of your `.org` document, add:

#+MACRO: scene-break SCENE-BREAK

You insert {{{scene-break}}} wherever you want a scene break.
{{{scene-break}}}

The macro expands to the literal text SCENE-BREAK.

After Org finishes generating the export, the filter org-export-replace-scene-breaks replaces all SCENE-BREAK markers with the correct text (three newlines, <br>, etc.).
